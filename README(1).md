# Project_7_NLPProject-for-Disaster-Tweet-Classification

## Project Description

Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.   
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time.   
Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).
